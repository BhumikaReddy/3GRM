# programming:
#	technique used to communicate with a computing device

#	require a language to communicate

#	computers understand machine language

#	programming languages are manmade - artificially - for  a particular purpose

# classification:
#	1. machine language
#	2. assembly language
#	3. high level languages
#		cobol
#		C
#		C++
#		Java
#		C#



# instructions written in these languages : program

# python is a programming language
#	designed by Rossum
#	named after Monty Python show
# version : 3.7

# translator:
#	converts a program in a high level language to a program in the machine language
#	converts the whole program together : compiler
#	converts line by line : interpreter
#	many translators follow something in between : mixed mode


# what are the ways by which we can talk to the computer using Python?
# 1. interactive mode
# 2. batch mode
#		put instructions in python in a file and execute them

# we get output in interactive mode;
# no output unless you ask for in batch mode
2 + 3

# display something : print
# is a function
